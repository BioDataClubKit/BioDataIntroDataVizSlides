Welcome to the BioData Club Introduction to Data Visualization workshop! This is a R Notebook file, which allows you to alternate between typing text (like here) and blocks of R code that you can run (see below)

```{r}
# This is a comment, lines that start with "#" inside the code block are not run as code
library(tidyverse)

head(ChickWeight)

ggplot(ChickWeight,
       aes(x = Time,
           y = weight,
           by = Chick)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Diet)
```
